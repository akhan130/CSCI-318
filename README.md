# CSCI 318 Web Development Project
> This Web Development Project was developed as part of a project for Programming Language Concepts. This project includes an HTML website hosted by Google Sites and a 
presentation developed using LaTeX. 

## HTML Website includes:
1. About page which introduces my team that worked on this project
2. Report page that has a report for our project
3. Slides page that displays the LaTeX slides we developed
4. Code page that has links to the source-code files of the HTML and LaTeX (those links are part of this repository)

## LaTeX Presentation:
The presentation developed teaches the viewer how to compute certain mathematical formulas step by step such as Graphs, Pythagorean Theorem, and Integrals

## Tools/Skills Utilized
1. HTML Programming
2. IntelliJ IDEA
3. Google Sites 
4. Overleaf LaTeX editor

## Reflections
1. Learnt how to utilize HTML to display presentations on a website
2. Improved web designing skills by adjusting format and user interface of the website with the help of HTML style attributes
3. Learnt how to host websites publicly after developing them with HTML
3. Learnt how to make visually appealing presentations with the use of LaTeX
4. LaTeX allows for adjusting formats of mathematical formulas which allows presentations to be more visually appealing compared to using a presentation software like Google Slides or Powerpoint where it can be difficult to get the exact formatting needed.
